**Hello World! ðŸ‘‹**

I am [Laurent Thiebault](https://linkedin.com/in/lauthieb), married, and a proud father of 2 children. Passionate about the web and technology in general! 

Currently, I am the Engineering Manager and Tech Lead of the [Decathlon Design System](https://decathlon.design).

I love learning new things every day, meeting passionate individuals, and sharing my knowledge with as many people as possible.

I also work part-time as a freelancer to assist companies with topics related to web development and Design Systems. In parallel, I provide free content related to these subjects on [my blog](https://lauthieb.dev/blog) and [my newsletter](https://webpreneurs.substack.com).

I am also passionate about Open Source and am always interested in working on new projects with new people. Feel free to check out my freelance profile on [Malt](https://www.malt.fr/profile/lauthieb) or contact me via [email](mailto:thiebault.laurent@gmail.com).
